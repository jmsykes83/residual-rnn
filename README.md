## Residual RNN

This repo is a Tensorflow implementation of paper [Full Resolution Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05148.pdf). This repo also contains a trained Residual LSTM model (saved in `save/`) on a small dataset (doesn't include dataset). Here is one example shown in the paper

Original image:

![original](kodim05.png)

Reconstruction:

![reconstruction](compressed.png)

### Requirements
- SciPy
- Tensorflow 1.4+

### Usage
Training, put training data in `imgs/` folder and run following code for default setting. The model parameter can be modified in `model.py`. Running time comparison of original and reconstructed images can be seen in `eval/`. Model file is saved in `save/model`.

```
python train.py
```

Encoding

```
python encode.py --model save/model --input imgs/kodim05.png --iters 10 --output eval/compressed.npz
```

Decoding

```
python decode.py --model save/model --input eval/compressed.npz --output eval/compressed.png
```

Evaluation, code from Tensorflow's official [repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/compression/image_encoder/msssim.py)

```
python msssim.py -o imgs/kodim05.png -c eval/compressed.png
```
